        <h3>First learning experience of web development</h3>
       <p> Welcome to my first blog post! Here, I'll be sharing my journey how i am learning web development.</p>
    
         <p>Actually it was not unexpected idea to learn about web development, i have much thoughts of learning web development from starting before i didn't have bought laptop and at that time i found coding an alien language so i dropped idea until i bought my first laptop.</p>
      
      <p>When i bought my first laptop i was serching something that can give me interest or it can be said i was searching for my passion.</p>
      
      <p>It was at that time i did personality test and i found my logician personality traits.</p>
      
      <p>It was mind blowing experience when your few answers can tell your whole life, personality test told me about myself more than others.</P>
  <P>I learned about my talent for data analysis and software development, my first choice was actually data analysis, i even started learning MS excel.</p>

<p>The reason for my attraction for data analysis was because of some personal desires like i will become data engineer and i can pridict market, i can invest in various field and i will become great businessman.</p>

<P>When i started learning data analysis, i soon found biggest negative factor that stopped me from going deeper into that field, i began to take more rest in between of my study session</p>

<p>It can be said pretty normal for anyone taking rest between studies but that was not okay for me, i have had many hobbies before like reading novels, playing games, watching movies but during those, forget about taking rest, i even forgot to take food and sleep.</p>

<p>It was mostly because of interest that i did those thing 16-18 hours 7days a week for year,but that was not same for data analysis and then i began to read about web development or it can be said coding.</p>

<p>The few days of coding were really about learning alien language but i found it like a game, i was understanding nothing but i was still going on, then i began to releted process of web development with different real world examples and i began to understand many things.</p>

<p>this is my first week but i am directly developing my personal blog so there is progress.</p>
  I will continue my journey of web development and write here so thanks if someone is reading this.
